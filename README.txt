DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT

    Very short:
    Hourly planner / Tuntipäiväkirja
    
    In short:
    Users can write down what they have done during hours for any given day.
    
    Users log in what they have done during the day and for how many hours. 
    Chores from which users pick can be customized for users needs,
    so they do not have to write the same chore over and over again. 
    Besides picking chore, users also pick how many hours they did it and during which hours. 
    There is also a comment section field that is optional to fill, that is reserved for
    further explanation of done work.
    
    Days are shown per week (or month if clicking a day is ease) by default.
    
    There is no backend!
